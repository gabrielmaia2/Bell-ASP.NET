## Business rules

All products should return 20% of the sale price to the company.

The data should be stored in a MySql database.

## Data specifications

When creating new tables based on models, the names of the columns should always follow the names of the properties in snake_case (e.g. DataProperty property would correspond to the column data_property).

Primary keys should have their names specified as PK_(type_name).
